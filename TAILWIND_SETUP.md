# Tailwind CSS Setup Instructions

## Current Status

-   ✅ Tailwind CSS is configured in `tailwind.config.js`
-   ✅ CSS imports are set up in `resources/css/app.css`
-   ✅ Laravel Mix is configured in `webpack.mix.js`
-   ✅ CDN fallback is added to layouts

## To Compile Tailwind CSS (when npm is available):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile for development
npm run dev

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Compile for production
npm run prod
```

## Current Workaround

Since npm compilation isn't available, we're using:

1. **Tailwind CDN** in layouts for immediate styling
2. **Font Awesome CDN** for icons
3. **Custom Livewire Layout** for consistent styling

## Files Updated:

-   `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Added Tailwind CDN
-   `resources/views/layouts/livewire.blade.php` - New Livewire-specific layout
-   `app/View/Components/LivewireLayout.php` - Layout component
-   Test views updated to use new layout

## Benefits:

-   ✅ Immediate Tailwind CSS support
-   ✅ Consistent styling across components
-   ✅ Font Awesome icons working
-   ✅ Responsive design support
-   ✅ Debug-friendly layouts

## Production Notes:

For production, compile the CSS properly:

1. Run `npm run prod`
2. Remove CDN links from layouts
3. Use compiled `public/css/app.css`
